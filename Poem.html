<h1> O Captain! My Captain! </h1>
<hr> 


<b>
<p> O captain my captain! our fearful trip is done <br>
    The ship has weathere'd every rack, the price we sought is won, <br>
    The port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting, <br>
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grime and daring; <br>
 <br>
    But O heart! heart! heart! <br>
    O the bleeding drops of red, <br>
    Where on deack my captain lies, <br>
    Fallen cold and dead. <br>
 <br>
    O captain! My captain! rise up and hear the bells; <br>
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bungle trills, <br>
    For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, <br>
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; <br>
    Here Captain! dear father! <br>
    This arm beneath your head! <br>
    It is some dream that on the deck, <br>
    You’ve fallen cold and dead. <br>
<br>
    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, <br>
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, <br>
    The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, <br>
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; <br>
    Exult O shores, and ring O bells! <br>
    But I with mournful tread, <br>
    Walk the deck my Captain lies, <br>
    Fallen cold and dead. <br>
